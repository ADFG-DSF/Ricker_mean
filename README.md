# Ricker_mean

This repository contains a Rmarkdown document Adam Reimer created after attending a meeting with ADF&G staff about the log-normal correction in escapement goal analyses.

The network location for this repository is S:\RTS\Reimer\Ricker\_mean.

Files in this repository are:

-   lnalpha_c sim.R: This represent my 'working copy' for the functions and analyses used in the .qmd document. May not be 100% up to date with .qmd document.

-   dat_outlier.rds: a small simulated data set with a large outlier used to demonstrate a situation where a naive analyst might prefer to us an uncorrected version of log-alpha when calculating S_msy.

-   RIcker_mean.qmd: the .qmd file used to produce the summary document.

-   The other files/folders in this directory are for internal use. Note the \_quarto.yml file and .nojekyll files are required to publish to GitHub pages.
